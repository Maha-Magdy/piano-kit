# PIANO KIT

## About

A "Piano Kit" is a simple piano board containing the essential keys. Each of them is represented by an equivalent key in the keyboard, which allows the user to play some piano sounds.

The list of keys and matching sounds:
- D => DO

- F => RE

- G => MI

- H => FA

- J => SOL

- K => LA

- L => SI

- R => DO#

- T => RE#

- U => FA#

- I  => SOL#

- O => LA#

PS: After being inspired by Wes Bos' JAVASCRIPT30 course, I decided to follow it and build the Piano kit project to keep my hands dirty with JavaScript.

A screenshot of the Piano kit is presented below:
